# 🏥 Secure Electronic Health Record (EHR) System – Risk \& Security Analysis

# 

# This project provides a concise, professional assessment of the security posture of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system in a university hospital environment. It applies industry-recognized cybersecurity frameworks to identify risks, evaluate business impact, and recommend practical security controls.

# 

# 📌 Overview

# 

# Healthcare systems store highly sensitive patient information and must remain available 24/7. This project examines the EHR system from a cybersecurity perspective, focusing on:

# 

# Risk identification using the OCTAVE Allegro framework

# 

# Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to prioritize critical assets

# 

# Attack profiling to understand threat actors and damage scenarios

# 

# Actionable mitigation strategies to improve system resilience

# 

# 🛡️ Key Components

# 1\. OCTAVE Allegro Risk Assessment

# 

# Identifies the EHR as the primary critical information asset

# 

# Maps technical, physical, and personnel risk environments

# 

# Evaluates threats such as phishing, ransomware, insider misuse, and DDoS attacks

# 

# Provides high-level mitigation recommendations

# 

# 2\. Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

# 

# Scores essential components: EHR database server, network infrastructure, workstations, backup systems, and remote access

# 

# Sets RTOs and RPOs for recovery planning

# 

# Highlights assets with the highest operational impact

# 

# 3\. Attack Profiles \& Damage Assessment

# 

# Analyzes attacker motives and capabilities

# 

# Develops best-case, most-likely, and worst-case scenarios

# 

# Focuses on impacts to patient safety, availability, confidentiality, and compliance

# 

# Suggests administrative, technical, and physical controls

# 

# 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

# 

# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

# 

# Business Continuity \& Disaster Recovery

# 

# Threat Modeling \& Attack Profiling

# 

# Healthcare Security (EHR, PHI, GDPR/HIPAA concepts)

# 

# Documentation \& Structured Analysis
